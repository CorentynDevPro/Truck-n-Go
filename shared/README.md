# Shared - Types and Utilities

## Convention

- All common types (e.g., `TruckProfile`, `User`, etc.) are defined here.
- Use strict TypeScript types to ensure type safety across the application.
- Unit tests for each critic utility function.

## Importing example

```typescript
import { TruckProfile, User } from 'shared/src/types/TruckProfile';
```
